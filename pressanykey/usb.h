/** General notes: The terminology of this USB stack tries to adhere to the USB specification.
 * This helps reading the code and the spec, but may be confusing in the beginning.
 * For example, directions always relate to the host: IN means device-to-host,
 * OUT means host-to-device.
 *
 * Unless otherwise noted, endpoints are addressed by physical endpoints on the device.
 * Physical epIdx: bit 0: direction (0 = OUT, 1 = IN)
 * Physical epIdx: bits 1..4: logical endpoint number
 * USB spec endpoint address: bits 0..3: logical endpoint number
 * USB spec endpoint address: bit 7: direction (0 = OUT, 1 = IN)

 * device-specific commands (setup packets on the control out pipe). Otherwise, set to NULL.
 * The function is called upon arrival of a new control setup block, before the
 * USB driver handles standard requests, so that the callback can override standard behaviour.
 * Implementations should check the current setup packet in the global variable usbCurrentCommand.
 * If the callback handles the command, it should return true, false otherwise. If data is to be
 * transferred within the command's data phase, the callback should set the global
 * usbCurrentCommandDataBase to the base of the send / receive buffer (determined by the
 * direction bit in usbCurrentCommand.bmRequestType) and the number of bytes to transfer into
 * usbCurrentCommandBytesRemaining. Additionally, it may set usbControlOutDataCompleteCallback or/and
 * usbControlStatusCallback to be notified when the data or status phase of the command has completed. */

 * the buffer is not filled, read requests by the host are silently NAK-ed.
