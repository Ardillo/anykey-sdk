/** General notes: The terminology of this USB stack tries to adhere to the USB specification.
 * This helps reading the code and the spec, but may be confusing in the beginning.
 * For example, directions always relate to the host: IN means device-to-host,
 * OUT means host-to-device.
 *
 * Unless otherwise noted, endpoints are addressed by physical endpoints on the device.
 * Physical epIdx: bit 0: direction (0 = OUT, 1 = IN)
 * Physical epIdx: bits 1..4: logical endpoint number
 * USB spec endpoint address: bits 0..3: logical endpoint number
 * USB spec endpoint address: bit 7: direction (0 = OUT, 1 = IN)
